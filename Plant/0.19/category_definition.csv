categories,definition
architecture,"The organization of parts that conform a complex structure and may dictate the form at a macro or micro-morphological level.  Differentiate this category from Arrangement, Shape, and Structure. Architecture emphasizes the composition of an organ (have or have not a part) and the position of its components in it, e.g. antherless,  bimucronate; Arrangement emphasizes the placement of similar organs in space, e.g. clustered, alternate; Shape is the appearance e.g., linear, incurling are shapes of a leaf. When difficult to determine the best category, put the term in two or all three categories. Nouns such as leaves, flowers go into Structure.  "
arrangement,"The disposition of similar structures with respect to one another or in respect with a plane or axis. E.g. whorled, distichous."
behavior,"Structure or organism's behavior aggregate of the responses or reactions or movements in a given situation. E.g. sensitive, fast-growing."
character,"An attribute of a structure. This category holds the names of attributes,e.g. color, shape. "
coating,"A state described as certain substance covering the surface of a structure, e.g, sticky, dusty, greasy. Differentiate this category from Pubescence, Relief, and Texture. "
substance,"Physical material existing in a structure or secreted by a structure, such as nector, oil. Differentiate this category from Architecture and Function. Terms describing the presence or absence of a substance, such as starchy or tanniferous should go in Architecture. Terms describing the capability of exudating certain substance, such as oil-secreting go in Function."
coloration,"A visual appearance with regard to color, including hue, intensity, or pattern of colors, e.g. dark red, spotted. Differentiate this category with Reflectance. "
condition,"An affecting state or circumstance, often temporary, a structure or organism is in. E.g., frozen, broken, wilty."
course,"Linear, one-dimentional shape of the center line through the length of an axis or vein, e.g. spiraling, straight, zig-zagged."
dehiscence," The mode of opening of a structure, which permits the escape of the content contained within it, e.g.  stegocarpous, schizogenous, undehisced. Differentiate this category from Architecture, which emphasizes structural composition of the parts of a structure, e.g., triporate [3-pores]. "
density,"The closeness of a group of similar structures are distributed as mass per unit area/size, e.g., dense, sparse."
depth,The distance between upper and lower or between dorsal and ventral points of a structure

development,"Mode or sequential pattern of growth or differentiation, e.g. centrifugal, centripetal, well-developed, differentiated."
distribution,"Geographical names of countries, states or regions, including cardinal directions, e.g., eastern. This category contains proper names, e.g., Arizona. Differentiate this category from Environment."
duration,"The extent of lifetime, or persistence and physical state after maturation, e.g., annual, overwintering, deciduous, evergreen."
fixation,"Mode of attachment to a supporting structure, e.g., affixed, adpressed. Differentiate this category from Fusion."
fragility,"Resistance or capacity of being damage or destroyed, e.g. fragile, sturdy."
function,"Action or activity based on a biological process, e.g., digestive, generative, storage, sensory."
fusion,"Physical connection of homologous or non-homologous structures, e.g., subfree, connate, suppressed, unattached, synconnective. Differentiate this category from Fixiation."
germination,"A process wherein a dormant embryo or spore resumes active growth, e.g., cryptocotyloid, germinating, phanerocotyloid."
growth_form,"The general appearance or function of a whole organism (e.g. growth form of a plant). E.g., tree, shrub, shrubby."
growth_order,"Terms that specify the order in which a structure growth in reference to other similar structures. E.g., first, last. Differentiate this category from Development. "
habitat,"The immediate environment or substrate where an organism occurs, e.g., wetland, lake, roadside. Differentitate this category from Distribution."
height,"The distance from the bottom to the top of a structure, e.g., tall, taller, short, shorter"
length,"The distance from one end of a structure to the other end, e.g., long, longer."
life_cycle,"Life stages or events of a structure or organism, including states after life, e.g. budding, fruiting, dormant, seed-shed, decayed. "
location,"Position with respects of environmental context, e.g. aerial, submerged. Differentiate this category from Position."
maturation,"Timing of the attaiment of functional maturity, sometimes relative to other structures, sometimes  as to constituent structures relative to each other. E.g. early-maturing, hysteranthours, protandrous."
nutrition,"An organism's mode of acquiring nutrients, e.g., autotrophic, mycoparasitic."
odor,"Olfactory stimulation or the lack of it, e.g.,  scentless, almondy, aromatic, fetid. This category overlap significantly with Taste category."
orientation,"The relative position of a structure to a reference point, line, or/and plane in space, e.g., erect, prostrate."
ploidy,"The number of sets of chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell, e.g., diploid, hexaploid, haploid. Note,  ""diplods"" goes into Structure, because the term refer to organisms with that character state. "
position,"The disposition of a structure with reference to some non-homologous (dissimilar) structures or larger context. E.g., adaxial, antipetalous, apical, axillary, basal. Differentiate this category from Location."
position_relational,"The disposition of a structure in direct relation to other dissimilar structures, with involving structures explicted identified. E.g., [A] covering, covered, embracing, reaching, [B]. "
prominence,"The degree or nature of evidence when present within the context in point, e.g., obscure, unremarkable, prominent."
pubescence,"Collective aspect of hairs, scales or bristles born on a surface, e.g., hairy, scaly, wooly. Differentiate this category from Relief, Coating, and Texture. "
quantity,"The quantity of a structure, e.g. many, few, fewer."
reflectance,"Aspect as to proportion and pattern of incident light reflected from the surface, e.g., glassy, glistening, glittering, glossy, polished. Differentiate this category from Coloration."
relief,"General topographic aspect of a surface, e.g., glabrous, sculptured, muricate. Differentiate this category from Pubescence, Coating, and Texture. "
reproduction,"The mode of reproduction or the mode of the development of reproductive organs, including characters of fertility, mating systems, dispersal and pollination strategies, and maturation or distribution of female and/or male flowers. E.g., agamospermous, allogamous, self-fertilizing, polycarpic . Reproductive organs/structures go into Structure."
season,"One of the four natural divisions of the year, spring, summer, fall and winter in the North and South Temperate zones OR one of the two divisions of the year, rainy and dry, in some tropical regions"
shape,"Overall two- or three – dimensional form or aspect thereof, e.g., rounded, spheroid,  folded,  folding, incurling."
size,"Absolute or relative extent in any one dimension or in an area or volume, e.g., big, medium-sized, small."
structure,"External and internal anatomical entities, including parts, spaces, lines, scars, constrictions, derived products, etc. Terms belonging to this category are nouns, e.g., leaves, stems. Adjective form of structure terms go into ""Structure_in_adjective_form"" category."
structure_in_adjective_form ,"External and internal anatomical parts, spaces, lines, and derived products. Terms belonging to this category are adjectives, e.g, bracteal, tigmatic.  Structure terms that are nouns go into ""Structure"" category."
structure_subtype ,"words describing the type of a structure, e.g. primary, "
taste,"Gustatory stimulation or the lack of it, e.g., acrid, almondy, fruity, spicy. This category overlaps significantly with Odor category."
taxon_name,"Taxon and vernacular names, or fragments of the epithet (genus or species). Do not categorize authorities."
texture,"Substantial properties as perceived by visual and tactile senses, e.g. bony, fleshy, leathery, papery, cartilaginous. Differentate this category from Pubescence, Relief, and Coating. "
toxicity,"Degree of toxicity or the lack of it, e.g., irritating, edible, nontoxic, toxic."
